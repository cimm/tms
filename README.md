# Twitter Memory Loss

Twitter Memory Loss is a small command line application to archive your Twitter statuses in a local databasea and optionally remove them from Twitter.

## Why

What happens online, stays online. Forever.

Back in 2006 Shaun Inman [redesigned](http://shauninman.com/archive/2006/10/16/the_9th_incarnation_of_shauninman_com) his blog to make older posts fade away when time passes. I wondered how the internet would look if data would fade with time. Do we really want and need all that personal data out there, forever?

This little application is a proof of concept to try to make the internet forget what we tweeted after a few months.

Alsoâ€¦ I have been removing my statuses manually for a little while and automating annoying processes is what programmers do.

## How to install

### Install

Make sure you have Ruby 1.9.x installed, a recent version of MySQL, and Bundler. Create a new MySQL database and install the Ruby libraries with `bundle install`.

Create a new Twitter application with read & write access and manually create an access token and access token secret on the Twitter application page.

### Configure

Rename the `settings.yml.sample` to `settings.yml` and have a look inside. Add the connection string for the database you created, the Twitter user you used to create the application, the consumer key and consumer secret as well as the access token and access token secret.

Set the maximum liftime for a status with the `lifetime_in_months` setting in the archiving section. All statuses created more than x months ago will be removed from Twitter (but kept in the local database).

## How to use

The application can be run manually:

    ./tms
    
but is intended to run as a crontab to gather new statues in an automated way.

## Known limitations

- The application will only work for public Twitter accounts. I might add protected accounts in the future but it's not a priority.
- Every time the application runs it will fetch the last 20 statuses from the user's public timeline. If there are more than 20 updates since the last run only the last 20 will be archived.
- The favorited and retweet counts are set the first time the status is downloaded, these values are not updated if more people retweet or favorite the status later.

**IMPORTANT** Removing statuses from Twitter doesn't remove them from 'the internet'. You statuses might be indexed by search engines and other 3th party services but it will remove them from your Twitter timeline.
